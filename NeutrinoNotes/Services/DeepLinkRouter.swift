/// Holds the note an inbound Universal Link asked for until the app is in a state to open it.
///
/// `https://www.getneutrino.app/open/note/<file id>` is how Drive (or an email, or the web app)
/// hands a note to this app. Only the id travels; the note itself is fetched from the server here,
/// so the reader always gets the current version and permissions stay server-side.
///
/// A link can land at any moment — including a cold launch straight onto the login screen, or while
/// the app-lock overlay is up. Rather than teach the open path about those states, the router just
/// remembers the destination and the view layer picks it up once the user is signed in. That is
/// also why nothing but `consume()` clears `pending`: a link that arrives before sign-in has to
/// survive the whole login round trip.
