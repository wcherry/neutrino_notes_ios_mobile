// MARK: - NeutrinoAppLink

/// The Universal Link vocabulary shared by every Neutrino iOS app.
///
/// A single link opens one Drive file in whichever app owns its format:
///
/// ```
/// https://www.getneutrino.app/open/note/0d0f7c…      -> Neutrino Notes
/// https://www.getneutrino.app/open/doc/0d0f7c…       -> Neutrino Docs
/// https://www.getneutrino.app/open/file/0d0f7c…      -> Neutrino Drive
/// ```
///
/// Only the *file id* travels in the link — never file contents and never a key. The receiving app
/// fetches the current version from the server itself, which is what keeps permissions centralised
/// and guarantees the user sees the latest revision rather than whatever Drive happened to have
/// cached. `v` (the server's `contentVersion`) may be attached as a hint; it is advisory only.
///
/// One path segment per app is what lets all three apps share a domain: the
/// `apple-app-site-association` document at `www.getneutrino.app` lists each app id against its own
/// `/open/<kind>/*` pattern, so iOS routes the link without the apps having to negotiate.
///
/// > Important: this file is duplicated verbatim in `neutrino_drive_ios_mobile` and
/// > `neutrino_docs_ios_mobile`. The three copies define one wire format between three separately
/// > shipped binaries, so a change here that is not mirrored there breaks links across app
/// > versions. See `agent_docs/plans/feature-universal-links.md`.
